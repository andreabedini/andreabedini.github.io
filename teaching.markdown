Teaching {.f1}
========

During my time at The University of Melbourne I taught:

### 2014 [Experimental Mathematics (MAST90053)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2014/MAST90053)

Modern computers have developed far beyond being great devices for numerical
simulations or tedious but straightforward algebra. _Experimental Mathematics_
covers some of the great advances made in using computers to algorithmically
discover and prove nontrivial mathematical theorems.

I was lecturer in charge for this subject. I produced a revised set of lecture
notes (available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/andreabedini/experimental-mathematics)),
Mathematica notebooks, assignments and exam questions.

### 2012 and 2013 [Calculus 2 (MAST10006)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2013/MAST10006)

_Calculus 2_ extends knowledge of calculus from school. I was part of a
lecturing team. I delivered lectures and practice classes. I produced and
marked assignment and exam questions.
