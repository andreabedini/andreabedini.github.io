title: Hello!

I am Andrea, I am a problem ~~maker~~ solver.

I have a PhD in mathematical physics and few years of research experience (see
[here](/academia/)).

I am based in Perth, Australia, and I work remotely for [Tweag](https://tweag.io) as a Software Engineer.

I like computers and I learned to program in BASIC when I was ten. These days I prefer writing [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

I organise the [Perth Functional Programmers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PerthFP/).

Back when I was in Melbourne, I started a science-based story-telling show called [The Laborastory](https://thelaborastory.com).
