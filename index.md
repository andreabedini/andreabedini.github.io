I am Andrea, I am a problem ~~maker~~ solver.

<!-- I likes to dive deep into problems, and sometimes this makes me an easy target for [nerd-sniping](https://www.xkcd.com/356/). -->

I have a PhD in mathematical physics and few years of research experience (see
[here](/academia/)).

I am based in Perth, Australia, where I work for [Fortescue Metals Group](https://www.fmgl.com.au) as a Data Scientist.

I like computers and learned to program in BASIC when I was ten; although these days I prefer [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

<!-- and I am trying to -->
<!-- learn some [Type Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/) -->
<!-- in my spare time (ask me about it!). -->

I organise the [Perth Functional Programmers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PerthFP/).

Back when I was in Melbourne, I started [The Laborastory](https://thelaborastory.com).
