Research
--------

### Critical phenomena in lattice polymers

![figure](/images/models.svg){.fr} My most reacent research focused on the
model of lattice self-avoiding trails. Self-avoiding trails are paths on a
lattice (like the square lattice picture in the figure on the right) which
can visit the same vertex twice but cannot cross the same edge more than
once.

My reseach studied the _critical_ properties of these geometrical objects.

This research has produced a number of unexpected results. I have shown
that the collapse of trails in three dimension exhibits a non-standard
scaling for which there is currently no theoretical prediction available. I
also explored how the phase diagram changes when we introduce a second
parameter such as stiffness or nearest-neighbour interactions.

Lattice trails are not only an important problem in the study of polymeric
systems. The geometry of intersecting paths lies at the base of our
theoretical understanding of many completely different phenomena, for
example it is connected to the role of disorder in the Anderson
metal-insulator transitions in two dimensions. The problem of
characterising the collapse transition of trails is considered an open
problem in the field, with contrasting predictions, both theoretical and
numerical.

### Exact calculation of graph polynomials

I developed an algorithm to compute the Tutte polynomial of a graph, an
object of central importance in both mathematics and physics. My algorithm
extends the traditional approach based on the transfer matrix with the
computer-science concept of tree-decomposition. The result is two-fold: a
software package to compute the Tutte polynomial of a given graph faster
than any other, and a very general framework that can be easily adapted to
compute many other kinds of graph polynomials.

This work allowed many researchers working on the chromatic polynomial to
state conjectures and to test hypotheses in a fraction of the time required
before.

The software is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/andreabedini/tutte) and was published through
Zeonodo (DOI
[10.5281/zenodo.15941](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15941)).

Using my algorithm I investigated the distribution of the roots of the
chromatic polynomial, over the ensemble of planar graphs. This is an area
of very active research given the numerous conjectures on the possible loci
of such roots that get stated and often disproven. The results of this
study have been published in Journal of Physics A (DOI
[10.1088/1751-8113/43/38/385001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/43/38/385001)).


### Super-symmetric methods in combinatorial problems

![figure](/images/hyperedge.svg){.fr} My PhD research was devoted to the
study of combinatorial problems through the use of a formalism based on the
Grassmann calculus. This is called a “fermionic” formalism in reference to
the Pauli principle, which states that two half-spin particles (fermions)
of the same kind cannot occupy the same physical state. This principle is
reflected in the nilpotency of algebraic variables. Using this formalism I
obtained formulas for enumerating the forest configurations (subgraphs
without cycles) one can draw on a graph.  My method is able to deal with
forests on a more general structure, a hypergraph, extending the results
previously only available for ordinary graphs. I proved that the asymptotic
behaviour of the number of forests on a hypergraph depends on the ratio
between the number of connected components in the forest (trees, in this
case) and the number of vertices in the hypergraph.  This fact gives rise
to a phase transition in the canonical ensemble, where a fugacity parameter
controls the number of trees.  Furthermore I proved that this phase
transition is consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a hidden
supersymmetry of the model and is associated with the appearance of a
“giant component”.


Teaching
--------

During my time at The University of Melbourne I taught the following
subjects.

### 2014 [Experimental Mathematics (MAST90053)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2014/MAST90053)

Modern computers have developed far beyond being great devices for numerical
simulations or tedious but straightforward algebra. _Experimental Mathematics_
covers some of the great advances made in using computers to algorithmically
discover and prove nontrivial mathematical theorems.

I was lecturer in charge for this subject. I produced a revised set of lecture
notes (available [on GitHub](https://github.com/andreabedini/experimental-mathematics)),
Mathematica notebooks, assignments and exam questions.

### 2012 and 2013 [Calculus 2 (MAST10006)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2013/MAST10006)

_Calculus 2_ extends knowledge of calculus from school. I was part of a
team of four lecturers. I delivered lectures and practice classes. I
produced and marked assignment and exam questions.
