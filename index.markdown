I am Andrea, I am a problem ~~maker~~ solver.

I have a PhD in mathematical physics and few years of research experience (see
[here](/research/) and [here](/publications/)).  I am a generalist who likes to
dive deep into problems, and sometimes this makes me an easy target for
[nerd-sniping](https://www.xkcd.com/356/).

I am based in Perth, Australia, where I work for
[Fortescue](https://www.fmgl.com.au) where I am some sort of Software
Architect. I have been programming computers since I was 10. These days I
like to program in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) and I am trying to
learn some [Type Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/)
in my spare time (ask me about it!).

I organise the [Perth Functional Programmers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PerthFP/).
Back when I was in Melbourne, I started [The Laborastory](https://thelaborastory.com).
