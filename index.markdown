Hello {#hello .f1 .mt5}
-----

I am Andrea, I am a problem ~~maker~~ solver.

I have a PhD in mathematical physics and few years of research experience
(see [here](/research/) and [here](/publications/)).

I might consider myself a generalist but I am an impulsive learner and I
like to dive deep into the problem at hand.

I work for [KZN Group](https://kzn.io) where I am a Data Scientist,
Engineer and Solution Architect. I got a couple of
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) certs.

I have been programming computers since I was 10. These days I like to
program in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) and I am trying to learn some
[Type Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/) in my spare
time.

I organise the [Perth Functional Programmers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PerthFP/).

Back when I was in Melbourne, I started [The Laborastory](https://thelaborastory.com).
